# Hamming Code

A simple program that performs Hamming Encoding on a .txt file.

HammingCode.go has two constant-value fields that define the default encoding configuration; if you want to change the configuration, just change the values and compile the code again.

The program receives the -c flag to encode a .txt file and generates another file of the same name with the extension .hamming.

The program receives the -d flag to decode a .hamming file and generates another file of the same name with the extension .dec.
